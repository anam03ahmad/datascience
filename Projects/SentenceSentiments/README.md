# Natural Language Processing - Binary Classification
# Sentence Sentiments

Objective Summary: I aim to determine if the underlying feeling of a particular product review is positive or negative, using Natural Language Processing techniques, and Deep Learning alorithms. I will essentially take a a set of reviews, clean them, determine predictive features, and design and train a deep learning model that will be able to predict the sentiment behind any given review.

Data: Obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences#

1000 reviews from Amazon, 500 positive and 500 negative

1000 reviews from Imdb, 500 positive and 500 negative

1000 reviews from Yelp, 500 positive and 500 negative

TOTAL: 3000 reviews, 1500 positive, 1500 negative


STEPS:
-Data Exploration - Nontextual features
-Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering
-Model Design and Training
-Model Validation


To run locally:
-install anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/
-clone github to a local folder
-using the anaconda prompt (or Terminal) cd to the direcotry with the git project and into Projects/SentenceSenitments
-run jupyter notebook
-open the step you would like to run (ex. exploring_data.ipynb)
-edit the path variable so it shows the correct path to the projects folder
-run
