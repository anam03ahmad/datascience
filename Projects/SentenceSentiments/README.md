# Natural Language Processing - Binary Classification
# Sentence Sentiments

Objective Summary:  
I aim to determine if the underlying feeling of a particular product review is positive or negative, using Natural Language Processing techniques, and Deep Learning alorithms. I will essentially take a a set of reviews, clean them, determine predictive features, and design and train a deep learning model that will be able to predict the sentiment behind any given review.

# Data
Obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences#  
1000 reviews from Amazon, 500 positive and 500 negative  
1000 reviews from Imdb, 500 positive and 500 negative  
1000 reviews from Yelp, 500 positive and 500 negative  
TOTAL: 3000 reviews, 1500 positive, 1500 negative  

# DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT STEPS:  
Step 1: Data Exploration - Nontextual features  
Step 2: Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering  
Step 3: Model Design and Training  
Step 4: Model Validation  

# To Run Locally 
Step 1: install anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/  
Step 2: clone github to a local folder  
Step 3: using the anaconda prompt (or Terminal) cd to the direcotry with the git project and into Projects/SentenceSenitments  
Step 4: run jupyter notebook  
Step 5: open the step you would like to run (ex. exploring_data.ipynb)  
Step 6: edit the path variable so it shows the correct path to the projects folder  
Step 7: select cells sequentially and click Run
